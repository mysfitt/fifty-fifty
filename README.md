# README

Academic project to illustrate a simple web service / web app. This is the web service portion of the application and it provides a few bits of functionality:

* Provide HTTP token based authentication for access to the service
* Provide a random algorithm that responds with a 503 error approximately 50% of the time
* Respond with a 200 and a random English dictionary word aproximately 50% of the time.

The database has to be seeded with the English dictionary. (I'm working on a rake task for this.)
